# Belief State Geometry
This is my attempt at reproducing the results in [arXiv:2405.15943](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.15943), specifically the development of the fractal structure of the context embeddings during training. More details can be seen on this [LessWrong post](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/qpwsdu7qBaHTaujE3/towards-understanding-the-representation-of-belief-state)
